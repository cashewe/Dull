# Dull

Dull is welsh mate its racist to pronounce it as dull and call me dumb for my boring tool.

The tool will make use of LLMs to create a 'strategic linter' - a tool which can be used to help guide a unified view of technical strategy within a team, despite 'strategy' being something which cannot be boolean identified via a traditional linter.

The target audience would be companies looking to super charge their python use without experienced staff engineers on hand to review every PR etc...
