# Dull

Dull is welsh mate its racist to pronounce it as dull and call me dumb for my boring tool.

The tool will make use of LLMs to create a 'strategic linter' - a tool which can be used to help guide a unified view of technical strategy within a team, despite 'strategy' being something which cannot be boolean identified via a traditional linter.

The target audience would be companies looking to super charge their python use without experienced staff engineers on hand to review every PR etc...

# TODO:

- create a default behaviour [X]
- create the option to use toml files to overwrite the defaul behaviour [X]
- refactor the prompts to use the txt files [X]
- create the option to use cmd commands to overwrite the toml behaviour [X]
- get access back to my github so i can test the prototype, and fix any glaring bugs []
- trim all unneccessary code away until all thats left is the bare minimum [X]
- ensure the suggested design scales well for future feature extension, potentially could use the tool itself for this just for fun tbh [X]
- pick a new name as despite finding dull to be hilarious, its likely already take on pypi []

once we get these points ticked ^^ we will have an MVP and can consider it ready to translate into rust.
